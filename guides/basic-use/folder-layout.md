The [`ember new`](../cli-commands/#createanewapp) command generates the files and boilerplate directory structure for an Ember application. The tables list the directories and files generated for a new application.  See the Ember [tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/) for more information how these are used when developing an application.

#### Layout within `app` directory

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="col-32">File/directory</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/app.js</code></td>
      <td>The application’s entry point. This is the first executed module</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/index.html</code></td>
      <td>
        The only page of the generated single-page app. Includes dependencies, and kickstarts your Ember application. See <code>app/index.html</code> below
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/router.js</code></td>
      <td>
      The applications route configuration. The routes defined here correspond to routes in <code>app/routes/</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/styles/</code></td>
      <td> 
        Contains the stylesheets, whether SASS, LESS, Stylus, Compass, or plain CSS (though only one type is allowed, see Asset Compilation). These are all compiled into <code>/dist/assets/&lt;app-name>.css</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/templates/</code></td>
      <td>
        The application's HTMLBars templates. These are compiled to <code>/dist/assets/&lt;app-name>.js</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>app/controllers/, app/models/, etc.</code></td>
      <td>
        The JavaScript files or modules that contain the applications logic
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note: The files in the `app/` directory are shown are for the `classic` project files layout. The layout will be slightly different if you use the `pods` project layout. See [Project Layouts](../../advanced-use/project-layouts/) for the differences between the two layouts.

#### `app/index.html`

The `app/index.html` file lays the foundation for the Ember application. This is where the basic DOM structure is laid out, the title attribute is set, and stylesheet/JavaScript includes are done. 

In addition to this, the file includes hooks - `{{content-for 'head'}}` and `{{content-for 'body'}}` - that can be used by addons to inject content into the application’s `head` or `body`. 

These hooks need to be left in place for the application to function properly however, they can be safely ignored unless you are directly working with a particular addon.

## Naming conventions

[Ember Resolver](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-resolver) is responsible for looking up code in your application and resolving its dependencies. The Resolver asks that you follow Ember's naming conventions.

If you use Ember CLI (`ember generate`) to create components, routes, etc., Ember will create files with correct names. In case you may manually create files, let's go over the naming conventions.

### File and directory names

File and directory names use `kebab-case` with lowercase letters and a hyphen between words.

```javascript {data-filename=app/models/user.js}
import Model from '@ember-data/model';

export default class UserModel extends Model {};
```

```javascript {data-filename=app/helpers/round-up.js}
import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';

export default helper(function roundUp(params/*, hash*/) {
  return params;
});
```

Files can also be nested to better manage your applications, for example:

```javascript {data-filename=app/routes/posts/new.js}
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default class PostsNewRoute extends Route {};
```

Nested files can be referenced as either `posts/new` or `posts.new` when used in templates or JavaScript. 

### Components

`PascalCase` is used for components. For example, the `nav-bar` component

```handlebars {data-filename=app/components/nav-bar.hbs}
<nav>
  ...
</nav>
```

would be resolved from the `PascalCase` component name in a template.

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/application.hbs}
<NavBar />
```

Component files can also be nested. You will need to use a special syntax to resolve a nested component. For example, if the `nav-bar` component were in the `ui` directory,

```handlebars {data-filename=app/components/ui/nav-bar.hbs}
<nav>
  ...
</nav>
```

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/application.hbs}
<Ui::NavBar />
```

If a component is nested more than one level deep, separate each directory using double colons.

### Tests

When you use Ember CLI, Ember automatically creates a test file and suffixes the name with `-test.js`. If you want to manually create the file, make sure to suffix the name with `-test.js` so that your tests can run.

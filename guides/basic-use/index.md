## Prerequisites

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* Recent version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which comes included in `yarn` or `npm` 
* Mac users need [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) (not the npm version!)

First, we need to have a package manager installed. A package manager installs new dependencies from the command line, whether they are used as commands or in the app itself. Follow these installation instructions for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). While these two tools have somewhat different features, both are compatible with Ember app development.

We'll know installation is successful when `npm --version` or `yarn --version` returns the version number. 

It is recommend to install the most recent LTS (long term support) version of `node`. Restart the console after installing your package manager.

## Installing the ember-cli

```bash
npm install -g ember-cli
```

This will make the `ember` command available throughout your project folders. The installation is successful if `ember -v` returns a version number. When it is run inside of an Ember app directory, it will show the version of the app, otherwise it will show the globally installed version of the CLI.

### Additional steps for Mac and Linux users

For Mac and Linux users we recommend installing [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). Watchman helps correct for some buggy and inefficient file watching behavior. Do not use the `npm` package by the same name.

Mac users can install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install watchman
```

Linux users should follow the steps on the [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) website to build from the source.

If Watchman is not installed, a notice is displayed when invoking various commands ("Could not start watchman"). It's safe to ignore this message. However, file-watching won't be as smooth as it is with Watchman.

### Installing for Windows

Windows Vista and newer Windows versions are fully supported, although there are steps you can take to improve your experience.
You can find more information about this in our section on [Windows support](../reference/windows/)

## Getting help

Users of all operating systems can get community support for installation problems. A list of chat rooms, forums, and more is available [here](https://www.emberjs.com/learn/).

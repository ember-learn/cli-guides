Apps come in so many types, shapes, and sizes that it's not possible to cover every edge case or configuration in the main guides.

The Appendix is the home of content that may not be frequently used, but is very helpful to developers who are working with stubborn bugs, unusual constraints, or older apps.

Help add to this section by opening issues for the [ember-cli Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides).

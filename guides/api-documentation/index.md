The API docs for Ember CLI are mainly for addon authors, advanced Ember app developers, and contributors to the CLI itself.

[https://ember-cli.com/api/](https://ember-cli.com/api/) 

The docs are the main resource for information like build pipeline modifications, addon author APIs, advanced configurations, and more.

The API documentation is built from the code comments in the main CLI codebase, [ember-cli on GitHub](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli). If you spot an issue in the documentation, please open an issue or pull request on that repository.
